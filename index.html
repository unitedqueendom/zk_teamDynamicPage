				<h3 class="zkHeadline">Zepeng Kang</h3>
				<p class="zkbio">
					Zepeng Kang is a Chinese student in interactive media program, he did not talk much while in the class, but he is not shy. In fact, he is very outgoing in some area such as video games. He forced himself to learn English cause he knew as a second language speaker, being bad at English is not going to help in the future life in Canada. He started ESL first time in the winter, but he never been to a cold place like in Canada, so he failed all his course because he couldnâ€™t get up. The second time, clever Felix choose afternoon class and passed all of them. And it is time to do his final project.

				<h3 class="otherHeadline">Sarah</h3>
				<p class="otherbio"> 
					Zepeng again, since Sarah withdrew all her courses for this semester due to her anxiety. Zepeng took over all the part for this project. So there are no designer and developer, or Zepeng is both designer and developer. Hope Sarah can get rid of the anxiety in the future.
